    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello! I’m Muqadas Khan, a curious mind and passionate creator currently pursuing my degree in Computer Engineering at SSUET. From designing sleek websites to crafting dynamic mobile apps, I love transforming ideas into interactive digital experiences.
    <br> <br> My journey into tech started with a love for problem-solving and evolved into a full-blown passion for development. I specialize in front-end and back-end development, with hands-on experience in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, MySQL, and Flutter.
    <br> <br> Whether it’s a website, a mobile app, or a creative experiment, I enjoy every part of the process — from planning and designing to coding and debugging.I believe in continuous growth, creative thinking, and building solutions that are not just functional but meaningful. 
    <br><br> 
    My goal is to become a versatile full-stack developer who can adapt, innovate, and make a real difference through technology.
    <br><br> 
    When I’m not coding, you’ll find me exploring design trends, learning new tools, or brainstorming ideas for my next project. Every project I take on is a step forward in my learning journey, and I’m always excited to collaborate and push the boundaries of what I can create.
    <br><br> 
    Let’s build something amazing together!</p><br>
